# Swing #11 at the diversity ceiling — open-ended niche economy

Graded honestly, in the spirit of the other ten swings. **Outcome: partial win, not a clean
break.** Real, partitioned niches roughly *halve* the diversity collapse and roughly *double* the
kinds retained vs baseline — the best result of any swing so far — but they do not yet hold the
niche count flat or growing on single-seed runs, so this ships **dormant (all knobs default OFF)**,
not adopted.

## The diagnosis it acts on

- One currency (`amp`), so one way to win → one winner. Confirmed in code: every income path
  (`worldEnergy`, `localRes`, detrital harvest, fields) funnels through the *same*
  `amp[i]+=localRes[i]*genome.entropyK` conversion.
- The dominant selective term is **NFD** (`±NFD_STRENGTH=0.004`, ~5× the `entropyBaseline` drain),
  and it is **zero-sum** (rare gains exactly balance common losses) — a pure *rarity tax*.
- The 2–7 type collapses of prior swings are **limiting similarity**: coexistence on any *fixed*
  niche structure is capped at ≈ (spectrum width)/(niche width). Every prior lever redistributed a
  fixed niche count; none made the count itself grow. That is the real wall.

## What was built (`index.html`, `applyNicheEconomy()`; knobs default OFF)

Three composable levers, each its own knob so every control runs:

1. **Expanding cross-feed frontier** (`__NICHE_FRONTIER=1`). Resource lives on a spectrum of
   channels indexed by the heritable diet trait (`tend` dim 0). Harvest is trait-matched with a
   master-of-one ↔ jack-of-all **trade-off** (effort normalised to a fixed budget). Competition
   divides each channel among its consumers (frequency dependence by real resource competition, not
   a tax). A fraction of every harvest is re-deposited **downstream** (`b→b+OFFSET`) as fresh
   resource, so a thriving population builds the next niche.
   - **REAL income** (`__NICHE_REAL=1`, default when frontier on): harvested resource becomes
     genuine `amp`, so each channel has its **own carrying capacity** and coexistence count =
     number of supplied channels. Bounded by the existing metabolic brake, so it raises diversity,
     not headcount.
   - **Mean-centred control** (`__NICHE_REAL=0`): zero-sum like NFD — kept to *prove* a tax cannot
     beat limiting similarity.
2. **Biotic / coevolutionary niches** (`__NICHE_BIOTIC=1`). A **conserved** predation transfer
   carries `amp` up the diet ladder (prey in `b−1` lose exactly what predators in `b` gain), so
   every occupied channel creates a predation niche above it (Red Queen).
3. **Opcode-novelty** (`__OPCODE_NOVELTY=1`). Mean-centred bonus for running globally-rare opcodes,
   to break the "museum, lights off" coupling gap (~20 of 232 opcodes ever used).

Harness: `harness-oee.js` exposes all four as env knobs and reports `nicheOcc` (channels held by
life) plus a `niche_trend` verdict (`growing` flag).

## Results (SEED-fixed, single seed, headless `harness-oee.js`)

| condition | entropyRatio (late/early) | kinds_late | collapsing |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline (no knobs) | 0.44 | 5.0 | yes |
| all levers, mean-centred (v1) | 0.34 | 6.5 | yes (worse) |
| **frontier REAL, tapered supply** | **0.69** | 7.8 | yes (borderline) |
| frontier REAL, flat supply | 0.63 | **10.8** | yes |

Reading: the **mean-centred** version was no better than baseline (and slightly worse) — exactly as
theory predicts a zero-sum tax must be. The **real-income** version is a clear, repeatable
improvement (collapse roughly halved; kinds retained roughly doubled). Lever 3 alone also produced a
genuine genotype-exploration signal (VM length began to ratchet; first authored atoms appeared).

## Why it still doesn't cleanly break the ceiling (next swing)

- Residual single best mountain: supply taper (and, when flat, the births-average-toward-centre
  pull plus the weak `globalTend` homogeniser on `tend` dims 0–1) still concentrate diet over time.
- Bounded trait space (`tend` clamped ±1.2) ⇒ ≤16 channels ⇒ still a *finite* niche count. Genuine
  open-endedness needs the niche space itself to grow — e.g. let `DIMS` grow and tie new dimensions
  to occupied frontier, or make cross-feeding push an *unbounded* (non-wrapping) frontier.
- Multi-seed confirmation not yet run (single-seed verdicts are noisy; the "immobility held 7"
  lesson demands a control before adoption).

# Swing #12 — drifting niches ("Convergent Hunger")

**Idea.** A static niche, even a real one, lets diet re-concentrate then stop: a summit. So make
the supply PEAKS *drift* over the channel ring (moving attractors), so the profitable diet is a
moving target and no lineage can finish climbing. Knob: `__NICHE_DRIFT=1`.

**Result (seed 7, 6000 ticks): no improvement; marginally worse.**

| config | entropyBits early→late | kinds_late | occ early→late |
|---|---|---|---|
| stationary real frontier | 3.21 → 2.03 | 10.8 | 8 → 5.25 |
| **drifting (swing #12)** | 2.51 → 1.69 | 8.8 | 8.67 → 5 |

**Why — the sharp lesson.** Drift stops the system *settling* but does not *diversify* it: the
population tracks the moving peak **together**. A drifting attractor is still ONE attractor; with 3
peaks you get ~3 moving clusters — exactly the limiting-similarity count, now in motion. Convergent
Hunger is *convergent*: everything chases the same shifting targets. Drift changes the **dynamics**
(non-stationary) but not the **count**, and the ceiling is a ceiling on count.

**Consolidated conclusion across #11–#12.** Only one thing moved the needle: making niches a
**real, partitioned food source** (collapse roughly halved, kinds roughly doubled). Everything that
touched *how fitness is shaped* rather than *how many separated, simultaneously-supplied niches
exist* — rarity tax, mean-centring, drift — left the count where limiting similarity puts it.

# Swings #13–#14 — attack the count (N-dim cells; local competition)

- **#13 N-dim niche cells** (`__NICHE_NDIM=1`): diet is a cell in a 4-dim × 4-bin space (256 niches,
  combinatorial), each a real partitioned resource; empty cells accrue a colonisation bonus.
- **#14 local competition** (`__NICHE_LOCAL=1`, with #13): crowding your own diet-cell costs amp, so
  each niche has a hard local carrying capacity (NFD done right — real per-niche competition).

**Results (seed 7, 6000 ticks), entropyRatio = late/early entropy (≥0.7 = not collapsing):**

| config | entropyRatio | kinds_late | nicheOcc early→late |
|---|---|---|---|
| baseline | 0.44 | 5 | 7 → 5 |
| 1-D real frontier (#11) | **0.63–0.69** | ~11 | 8 → 5 |
| drift (#12) | 0.67 | 8.8 | 9 → 5 |
| N-dim cells (#13) | 0.35 (collapses harder) | 8.3 | 23 → 6 |
| N-dim + local (#14) | 0.65 | 9 | 22 → 6 |

**The pattern is the finding.** #13 has 256 niches and *starts* with 22–31 occupied, yet collapses
*hardest* — combinatorial capacity is not the constraint. #14's local competition rescues #13 from
0.35 back to 0.65, but **every lever — real income, drift, combinatorial space, local competition —
lands at the same ~0.65 wall, and none holds occupancy flat.** The system sheds diversity to the
same level no matter how much niche capacity or competition structure is added.

**Revised diagnosis (where the next swing must aim).** The binding constraint is no longer in the
niche/competition layer — it is **upstream of it**: diversity is generated faster than it can be
*retained*. Two upstream suspects, both pre-existing and untouched by #11–#14:
1. **Slow diet exploration.** Offspring inherit the parent's `tend` (birth averages parents) and
   `tend` mutates only ±0.0005/tick, so lineages cannot *spread* across niches fast enough to offset
   selective + seasonal concentration. The niches exist; nothing colonises them in time.
2. **Active homogenisers.** Every tick `tend` is pulled toward the population mean (the `globalTend`
   attractor, ~2e-5/tick), plus motif re-adoption and HGT — a persistent inward pull collapsing the
   diet axis regardless of niche structure.

The honest next experiment is therefore **not another niche mechanism** but to ablate/instrument the
homogenisers and raise diet-axis exploration, and measure whether retention (occupancy slope) goes
non-negative. All of #11–#14 ship dormant (knobs default OFF); stock behaviour unchanged.

# Swing #15 — retention, not capacity (the `globalTend` sink, and the local fix)

Credit: the mechanistic framing here came from a parallel instance and was decisive.

**The wall, analytically (not empirically).** Every tick, `tend[i] += (globalTend[d] − tend[i]) ×
2e-5` (index.html ~L17142): global mean-reversion on the diet axis. Against ±5e-4/tick mutation, the
mutation-vs-reversion balance pins the trait distribution at
`var ≈ injection/removal ≈ (5e-4)² / (2·2e-5) ≈ 0.006 → std ≈ 0.08`. On a [−1.2,1.2] axis with 4-bin
cells, std 0.08 fits inside one bin. **No downstream niche capacity can hold diversity when the
upstream trait distribution is pinned that tight** — which is exactly why #13 starts at 22–31
occupied cells and relaxes to ~6. The retention diagnosis is now mechanistic, not just observed.

**Diagnostic (seed 7, 6000 ticks, on #13+#14; `__GLOBALTEND` scales the sink, 0 = ablate):**

| config | occ_late | kinds_late | entropy_late | clusters_late |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| globalTend ON (stock) | 6 | 9 | 1.86 | 4 |
| globalTend OFF (ablated) | **11.25** | 13.8 | 2.48 | 10.5 (incoherent) |
| **localized — `__NICHE_LOCALTEND=1`** | 8.5 | 11.8 | 2.2 | **4 (coherent)** |

Ablating `globalTend` in isolation nearly **doubles** retained occupancy (6 → 11.25) — the single
biggest mover in the whole sequence, confirming it is the dominant sink. But full ablation blows
cluster coherence (4 → 10.5), which would cost the live piece its visual structure. **Localising the
homogeniser** — pulling each organism toward its own NICHE-CELL centroid instead of the global mean
(`__NICHE_LOCALTEND=1`, also on L17142) — recovers most of the diversity gain (occ 6 → 8.5, kinds
9 → 11.8) **while keeping coherence (4 clusters).** Within-niche coherence survives; cross-niche
divergence stops being punished. This is the fourth independent time the answer has been
"the global version concentrates; localise it" (cf. #14 local competition).

**Status.** Still not open-ended — slope stays negative (other sinks remain: HGT, motif re-adoption,
seasonal culls), so retention is improved, not yet self-sustaining. Remaining protocol, with
attribution discipline (one sink at a time): HGT/motif off next, then a diet-mutation sweep
(`__TEND_MUT`). **Validation caveat:** occupancy-slope ≥ 0 is necessary, not sufficient — a higher
mutation rate can inflate variance into a *smear* of tourists (the bin-inflation confound), so the
retained occupancy must be confirmed HERITABLE/persistent per cell (lineages stay), not a random
scatter. The coherent `clusters_late=4` under the localized fix is an encouraging (not conclusive)
sign of persistence. New knobs (`__GLOBALTEND`, `__NICHE_LOCALTEND`, `__TEND_MUT`, `__NICHE_CELLDRIFT`)
all default to stock behaviour.
